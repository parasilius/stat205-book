The JASP-specific revisions to the original book by Navarro and Foxcroft were made possible by a generous grant to Tom Faulkenberry from the Tarleton State University Center for Instructional Innovation. Also, many thanks to Kristen Bowman for creating the beautiful front and back cover art for the book.
