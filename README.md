# Introduction to Statistical Inquiry

This repository hosts materials for an ongoing textbook developed for STAT205 course at University of Calgary.
The project utilizes a template adapted from:

Navarro, D.J., Foxcroft, D.R., & Faulkenberry, T.J. (2019). Learning Statistics with JASP: A Tutorial for Psychology Students and Other Beginners.

In principle, this repository should include everything needed to reproduce the book from scratch.  Go to the `build` directory for instructions.

The latest PDF version of this book is available in the [Releases section](https://github.com/phrafsanjani/stat205-book/releases/tag/latest).
